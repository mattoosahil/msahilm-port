				<h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Companies are moving towards automation today to
                    increase the efficiency, quality and to reduce system
                    manipulation by human. Fuel distribution is a task with high
                    risk of security. The fuel is supposed to be secured from any
                    thefts. Our system is capable of automating the process of
                    fuel distribution. Our system provides safe transportation of
                    fuel with accurate distribution as per fuel requirements of
                    various Petrol pumps using RFID technology. The valves of
                    the petrol tank used for transportation until the Petrol pump
                    is authenticated. Also if there is any leakage in the tanker, it
                    can be immediately identified by our system. Adulteration of
                    fuel is very rampant; this is because the products of
                    comparable quantities has different price. Nowadays fuel is
                    being adulterated by the Petrol pump owners. These
                    malpractices are affecting the environment and
                    simultaneously affecting the vehicles. Fuel adulteration has
                    many effects, especially on any vehicle that uses such fuel;
                    there will be increase in the tailpipe emission of harmful
                    pollutants that affects the environment and the human
                    health. These practices are supposed to be stopped. Our
                    system can detect the adulteration at the Petrol pumps. After
                    detecting a foreign fluid in the petrol pump tank a message
                    will be sent to the Petrol manufacturer, notifying the
                    company about the adulteration along with the petrol pump
                    code. The most significant factor responsible for adulteration
                    is non-availability of real time institutional techniques that
                    followed universally for forthwith detection of adulteration
                    level. According to the reference paper “Estimation of petrol
                    and diesel adulteration with kerosene and assessment of
                    usefulness of selected automobile fuel quality test
                    parameters” by Sh. R. Yadav, Adulteration can be detected
                    using the fluid factors i.e. viscosity and density. RFID – Radio
                    Frequency Identification is a technology for tagging using
                    radio waves. According to reference paper “Fuel Pump
                    Dispensing System” by Mr. Rohit K, RFID technology can be
                    used for authentication.
                    A RFID tag is a small electronic device, supplemented with
                    an antenna that can transmit and receive data. The RFID
                    technology is designed for the unique identification of
                    different kinds of objects. Due to their small size the RFID
                    systems have a limited computational power, and limit
                    memory there for a "heavy" encryption algorithm can’t be
                    used by RFID systems.</p>

				<h2>Literature survey</h2>
				<p>
                    Difficulty in the composition of petroleum-derived fuels and
                    their potential adulterants leads to a challenging situation
                    where compliance and implementation of standard norms
                    are not easy. Widely approved and adopted standard
                    methods such as EN, ATSM, and ISO that encompass a variety
                    of properties for testing fuels. There is no particular
                    technique is precisely designed to assess the adulteration of
                    fuel while most of these techniques are equally applicable to
                    assess the adulteration of petrol and diesel fuels.
                    Due to price hike in petroleum products, adulteration is
                    being observed everywhere. Suppliers could have profit
                    about 10-15% by mixing petrol and various constituents.
                    There are several sensors were designed to define
                    theconcentration of adulteration in fuel samples. Fuel Adulteration detection sensor using IR
                    sensor/imaging processing
                    Jersha V and his co-workers have been described automatic
                    fuel adulteration detection and reporting system. In this fuel
                    adulteration detection technique, a sample of the fuel is
                    heated to a temperature which is equal to the boiling point of
                    the kerosene and petrol. In thecase of petrol, it is being
                    heated to a temperature equal to the boiling point of petrol
                    and in thecase of diesel, it is being heated to atemperature
                    equal to the boiling point of kerosene. So that any one of the
                    constituent fuel gets evaporated and another constituent fuel
                    is left in the in the sample. For instance, in the case of diesel
                    adulterated with kerosene, the constituent fuel left would be
                    diesel. Similarly, in the case of petrol adulterated with
                    kerosene, the constituent fuel left would be kerosene. From
                    this study amount of the fuel adulteration can be detected.
                    The quantity of the left-out sample after heating the
                    adulterated fuel is detected by using two different
                    techniques. The first technique employs Infrared (IR)
                    sensors and the second technique employs camera based
                    Imaging system for detection of sample level. At theend two
                    techniques were compared and image processing technique
                    has been given better results than IR detection technique.
                    
                    Fuel Adulteration detection sensor using Micro-
                    controller (ARM)
                    
                    S.D. Kale et.al had described a micro-controller based
                    technique for determination of adulteration concentration in
                    the sample. In this technique, fuel adulteration has done by
                    investigating various parameters such as viscosity and
                    density are which are determined by experimental setup and
                    whereas parameters such as temperature and humidity
                    determined by using sensors. The determined test results
                    
                    were compared with standard references using ARM micro-
                    controller which provides anoutput on LCD screen.
                    
                    Fuel adulteration detection sensor based on nonporous
                    silicon micro cavity
                    An optical sensor has been developed to estimate the
                    amount of adulteration in fuel sample using a porous silicon
                    microcavity which is fabricated using electrochemical
                    anodization method. Reflectance quantities are used to
                    Fuel Adulteration detection sensor using highly
sensitive electrical meta-material sensor
Vaishali R and her co-workershave developed a device which
works based on the electric meta material concept, i.e.
complementary split-ring resonator (CSSR), operating at
2.47GHz (The industrial, scientific, and medical radio band –
ISM band). This device is used to detect the kerosene
adulteration in petrol. The sensor is a CSRR circuit, which
exhibits sub-wavelength resonance having high sensitivity
and Q-factor. Further, a Polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) based
sample cavity is designed for micro-quantity sensing to make
the device more precise, sensitive and selective. A device
operating at 2.47 GHz is hence proposed for adulteration of
kerosene in petrol, varying up to 30 per cent. Unadulterated
samples (Standard samples) were derived from the
Company operated Company owned petrol pump, and the
adulterated samples were made in the laboratory for precise
calibration. Systematic variations in the resonance frequency
and magnitude were examined with adulterated fuels. The
sensing measurements were done on Vector Network
Analyser (VNA). The sensing was rapid and the recovery was
almost instantaneous; ensuring a sensitive and accurate
device for detection of adulteration in petrol.
Fuel adulteration detection sensor using long period
fiber grating technology
Vandana M et.al depicted the capability of long-period fiber
grinding (LPFG) sensor innovation to distinguish the
nearness of 10% contaminant in automotive fuels utilizing
LPFG method while the conventional advances can identify
nearness of about over 20% of the same. LPFG technique
involves the shift in the transmission spectra of the different
proportions of the fuel and this shift is an index of the fuel
quality.

				<h2>The system</h2>
				<p>
                    The system has two nodes. One is the petrol pump node and
another node is mobile tanker node.
Node1 (Petrol Pump):
This node is installed at a petrol pump. Here in the petrol
tank there will be a sensor to check if adulteration has
occurred or not. This is continuously monitored. If there is
change in the value of sensor, then a message will be sent to
the petrol pump owner. This indicates adulteration to the
petrol pump company. Level sensor is present to monitor the
level of fuel in tank. If the level of fuel in the tanker is less
than a particular value which will be set by the petrol pump
owner, then a message will be sent to petrol pump company
in order to place an order of fuel.
Node2 (Mobile Tanker):
This node is installed in the tanker which is supposed to
deliver the fuel to petrol pumps. There is a level sensor to
monitor the level of fuel in tank. Continuously this level
sensor data is provided to online database using IoT
technology. This helps in keeping a check on fuel, and also
helps in identifying embezzlement of fuel. RFID technology is
used to authenticate the petrol pump. The fuel will be
dispensed from the tank only if the RFID authentication
occurs. It also helps in providing the dedicated amount of
fuel to the petrol pump. This distribution is done with the
help of pump.
Advantages:
 Reduces Human Efforts
 Reduces Adulteration Process And Helps To Prevent it.
 Smart Distribution System Saves Manpower And Human
Efforts.
 Easy petroleum distribution and management.
 Secure petrol transactions.
 Provides control over third party distributors.
 Detection of fuel adulteration in real time is the most important need of the
world as it generates the hazardous effects on the environment, living and
nonliving things. Various automotive users and fuel providers may mix kerosene
in petrol and diesel. Adulterated fuel increases air pollution, as well as reduces
the performance of vehicle engines. Such a malpractice needs to be stopped, in
order to that we have proposed a system to detect adulteration using LDR
sensor, which will be later reported to the Fuel Manufacturing Company. We also
focused on automating the process of ordering the fuel using GSM technology.
Also our system provide safe transportation of fuel with accurate distribution as
per fuel requirements of various pump using RFID technology

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p> The proposed system is able to check the quality of the fuel.
                    These observations are real time. Along with the purity
                    check, the system provides a reliable fuel distribution
                    system. This helps in reducing the error which occurs during
                    distribution, reduces embezzlement of fuel and also reduces
                    adulteration activities at petrol pumps. Such malicious
                    activities can lead to cancellation of petrol pump license. The
                    system is capable of automating the process of ordering fuel.
                    This is not only beneficial for the petrol pump owner, but
                    also for the company.</p>
